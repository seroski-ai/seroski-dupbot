## 💻 Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js Guidelines

- **Use ES6+ features** (async/await, destructuring, etc.)
- **Use ESM imports** (not CommonJS require)
- **Follow consistent naming**:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Handle errors** properly with try/catch
- **Use meaningful variable names**

### File Organization

```
.github/
  scripts/          # Utility scripts
  workflows/        # GitHub Actions workflows
```

### Example Code Style

```javascript
import { Pinecone } from '@pinecone-database/pinecone';

// Use async/await
async function searchSimilarIssues(embedding) {
  try {
    const results = await index.query({
      vector: embedding,
      topK: 5,
      includeMetadata: true
    });
    return results.matches;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error searching issues:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Use descriptive names
const SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.7;
```

## 🧪 Testing
