# 🤖 Database Management Workflows

This repository includes several GitHub Actions workflows for managing your Pinecone vector database and duplicate detection system.

## 📋 Available Workflows

### 1. �️ Database Operations (Manual)
**File:** `.github/workflows/database-operations.yml`

Pure database management operations - no validation mixed in.

**Operations Available:**
- **Populate Issues** - Add existing GitHub issues to Pinecone database (skips duplicates)
- **Cleanup Duplicates** - Remove duplicate vectors (requires force flag)
- **Debug Database** - View database contents and statistics
- **Clear All Vectors** - ⚠️ **DANGER:** Delete all vectors (requires force flag)

**How to use:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Select **"Database Operations"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Choose your operation and enable force flag if needed
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

### 2. 🔍 API Validation (Manual)
**File:** `.github/workflows/api-validation.yml`

Pure API connection testing - run before database operations.

**Validation Scopes:**
- **All APIs** - Test all connections (Pinecone, GitHub, Gemini)
- **Pinecone Only** - Test only Pinecone database connection
- **GitHub Only** - Test only GitHub API connection  
- **Gemini Only** - Test only Gemini AI API connection

**How to use:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Select **"API Validation"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Choose validation scope
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

### 3. 🔍 Duplicate Issue Management (Automatic + Manual)
**File:** `.github/workflows/duplicate-issue.yml`

Handles duplicate detection automatically and allows manual checks.

**Automatic triggers:**
- When issues are opened, edited, or reopened
- Automatically cleans up when issues are closed

**Manual triggers:**
- Check any specific issue number for duplicates

### 4. 🎉 PR Welcome Message (Automatic)
**File:** `.github/workflows/pr-welcome.yml`

Automatically welcomes all contributors when they open a pull request.

**Automatic triggers:**
- When a pull request is opened
- Posts a friendly welcome message immediately

**What contributors receive:**
- Thank you message with their username
- Clear explanation of the review process (3 steps)
- Links to contributing guidelines and documentation
- Encouragement to ask questions
- Bot signature with developer portfolio link

**Benefits:**
- Makes contributors feel appreciated immediately
- Sets clear expectations about the review process
- Reduces maintainer workload with automated responses
- Maintains consistent, professional communication
- Encourages future contributions

## 🎯 **Usage Examples:**

### **Recommended Workflow:**
1. **Validate APIs First:** Actions → API Validation → Choose "all-apis" → Run
2. **Then Perform Operations:** Actions → Database Operations → Choose your operation

### **Common Operations:**
- **Validate APIs:** Actions → API Validation → Choose "all-apis" → Run
- **Populate Issues:** Actions → Database Operations → Choose "populate-issues" → Run
- **Clean Up Duplicates:** Actions → Database Operations → Choose "cleanup-duplicates" → ✅ Enable Force → Run
- **Check Database Health:** Actions → Database Operations → Choose "debug-database" → Run
- **Emergency Clear All:** Actions → Database Operations → Choose "clear-all-vectors" → ✅ Enable Force → Run

## 🛠️ Local Scripts (npm commands)

You can also run these operations locally:

```bash
# API Validation (NEW!)
npm run validate              # Test all API connections
npm run validate:pinecone     # Test only Pinecone connection  
npm run validate:github       # Test only GitHub connection
npm run validate:gemini       # Test only Gemini API connection

# Safe operations
npm run populate-issues       # Add existing issues to database
npm run debug-db             # Check database status
npm run check-duplicates     # Check for duplicates

# Cleanup operations  
npm run cleanup-duplicates --force    # Remove duplicates
npm run cleanup-issue                 # Remove specific closed issue

# Dangerous operations (use with caution!)
npm run clear-all:force              # ⚠️ Delete ALL vectors
```

## 🔐 Required Secrets

Make sure these secrets are configured in your repository:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key
- `PINECONE_API_KEY` - Your Pinecone API key
- `PINECONE_INDEX` - Your Pinecone index name

## 🚨 Safety Features

- **Force flags required** for destructive operations
- **Confirmation prompts** in scripts
- **Continue-on-error** for non-critical operations
- **Detailed logging** for troubleshooting
- **Verification steps** after dangerous operations

## 📊 Workflow Status

Check the **Actions** tab to see:
- ✅ Successful operations
- ❌ Failed operations with detailed logs
- 📋 Summary reports for each run

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **API Rate Limits**
   - Wait a few minutes and retry
   - Check the logs for specific error messages

2. **Connection Failures**
   - Use "Test Connection" in Quick Actions
   - Verify your API keys are correct

3. **Database Issues**
   - Use "Debug Database" to check current state
   - Check Pinecone dashboard for index status

4. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure GitHub token has `issues: write` permission
   - Check repository secrets are properly set

### Getting Help:

1. Check workflow logs for detailed error messages
2. Use the debug tools to understand current state
3. Run test connections to verify API access
4. Check this README for common solutions

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Run "Populate Issues" after major issue imports
   - Use "Debug Status" to monitor database health
   - Clean up duplicates periodically

2. **Before Major Operations:**
   - Always run "Debug Database" first
   - Test connections to ensure APIs are working
   - Have a backup plan (you can repopulate from scratch)

3. **Safety First:**
   - Never use force flags unless you understand the consequences
   - Test operations in a development environment first
   - Keep your API keys secure and rotated regularly
